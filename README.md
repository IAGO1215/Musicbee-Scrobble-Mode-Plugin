# Musicbee Scrobble Mode Plugin

A plugin developed for people who listen to music for last.fm scrobbles. Musicbee will automatically jump to next track in the upcoming tracks list, once the current playing track has reached half of its length or four minutes.

Warning: This plugin will affect skip counts.

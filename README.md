# Musicbee Scrobble Mode Plugin

A plugin developed for people who enjoy listening to music but also account for last.fm scrobbles. With this plugin, Musicbee will automatically jump to next track in the upcoming tracks list, once the current playing track has reached half of its length or four minutes (the rule which last.fm uses to count whether a playback is a scrobble). 

## ***Known Issues*** ## 
1. If the plugin is enabled during playback, the current playing track will be skipped regardless of whether it has passed half of its duration or 4 minutes. 
2. This plugin will not affect skip counts. 
3. If you want to enjoy the entire track, you should turn off this plugin in "Preferences -> Plugin" and restart musicbee. The restart is mandatory to disable this plugin. 

## ***Plans*** ##
1. Let users to custom a fixed timestamp or an adaptive one to automatically jump to next track. 
2. Try to see the possibility that turning off plugin doesn't require restarting musicbee.
